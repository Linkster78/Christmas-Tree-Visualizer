## What is this?
This is a visualization tool to create lighting effects Ã  la Matt Parker.<br>

While the plan was to use this for our real christmas tree the project hasn't been completed yet. Maybe next year! ðŸ¤ž
> Most of the work is done, a driver and a corresponding Python library were created to interface with the LED lights through an ESP32.

## Usage
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
